# Henry MacAfee's Portfolio - henry-macafee-fresh

Welcome to the repository for Henry MacAfee's portfolio. This site features a few hobby projects I have built. Built using the power of Next.js 13, it aims to provide a seamless browsing experience while leveraging the latest web development technologies.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

3. **Install the Dependencies**:

4. **Run the Development Server**:

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the site.

## To-Do

- [ ] Move static project resources to a document store service like Supabase.
- [ ] Cleanup the component structure to better leverage React Server Components.
- [ ] Tweak the application structure to make the most of conventions established in Next.js 13.
- [ ] Add more features to leverage serverless functions and demonstrate CRUD.
